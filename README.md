## General Info

It is the end of the chapter project and it was done as a team work. The project was built using React.

Due to the time limitation in the project, some minor errors that do not affect the system have been ignored.

This project is important because it shows that the Single Page based React Library can use important concepts such as useEffect, useReducer, useContext.

Since the backend has not been learned yet in this project, array has been used as a database.
